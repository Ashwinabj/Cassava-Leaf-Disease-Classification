# Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification
I created an Artificial Intelligence powered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to tackle the problems faced by farmers during the cultivation of Cassava Plants and to automate the detection of diseases in plant leaves. My CNN model was able to identify the disease present in the plants by looking at its leaf images.
